# acompiler
A compilation of EECS 665 (Compiler Construction) projects that will eventually build a compiler... hopefully.
Requirements to run:
  Linux Terminal(Preffered)
    Ubuntu in Windows Store - https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview
  Flex: a tool for generating lexical analyzers
    sudo apt install flex
  Bison: parser generator that converts an annotated context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR (1) parser tables
    sudo apt install bison
  Makefiles: for convenience to run everything with ease
    sudo apt install make
